Work in progress

==How to start==
 python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8888

==Dependacies==
Requires django (>1.6.4)
Check the version using 
python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"

==Setting==
Chnage the values in zonemanage/config.py


==Apache WSGI setting==
Copy the zonemanage.conf into the /etc/httpd/conf.d/zonemanage.conf
if running in apache wsgi mode make sure /var/tmp/zonemanage_archive/ (or archive direcotry is owned by apache user)

==WARNING==
Due to the nature of Zonemanage, your Apache user will need to have
higher permission levels than normal for a public webserver. It is HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED to keep Zonemanage on a non-public server or at least isolate it and
monitor access to the server closely.

Zonemanage will require apache to have write permission on named.conf and all zone files ( /var/named/chroot/var/named/*). 
To achive this add  the apache user in named group and have the write permission to above files for named group.

If you are switching to Zonemanage from an existing configuration, make sure to
have current backups of your existing DNS setup.
